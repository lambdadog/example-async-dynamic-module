# example-async-dynamic-module
An example of using
[`open_channel`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Module-Misc.html#index-open_005fchannel)
to implement asynchronous functions in emacs dynamic modules.

Obviously a particularly contrived example and in the real world you
would probably prefer to use a thread pool of some sort, but works.
